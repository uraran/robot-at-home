Initial release of the code I use to run the robot so far.
Some implementations are a bit cheesy but they work fine for me, for now.


Kickstart:

1. Try to compile everything using the buildall.sh script.
2. Goto the bin directory and test the ctllauncher driver.
   Try "sudo ./ctllauncher" after connecting the thing to your usb port.
   You should get two numbers telling you the sensor status, or an error message.
   Now try "sudo ctllauncher 5" to turn two motors on. Stop them with "sudo ctllauncher 0".
3. Try the uvccapture with "./uvccapture" or "./uvccapture -m" and check the snap.jpg.
   If this doesn't create the snap.jpg usw "./uvccapture -h" and help yourself.
4. Try the Java UsbController class with "sudo java UsbController"
   and enter something like "wwwwaaaassssddddq" in the console and press enter.
   Your robot should now make a little dance ;-P
5. Go for it and try "sudo java WebBot"! Then connect to http://localhost:8181

PS: You need to install espeak for the tts-feature. "sudo apt-get install espeak"
